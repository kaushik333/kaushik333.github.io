Retrieving such information poses significant challenge as most of the existing academic search engines are primarily based on only the text content. In this paper, we introduce Diag2Graph, an end-to-end framework for parsing deep learning diagram-figures, that enables powerful search and retrieval of architectural details in research papers. Our proposed approach automatically localizes figures from research papers, classifies them, and analyses the content of the diagram-figures. The key steps in analyzing the Figure content is the extraction of the different components data and finding their structural relation. Finally, the extracted components and their relations are represented in the form of a deep knowledge graph. A thorough evaluation on a real-word annotated dataset has been done to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.","tags":[],"title":"Diag2graph: Representing Deep Learning Diagrams in Research Papers as Knowledge Graphs - ICIP 2020","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1602983705,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602983705,"objectID":"4ca7985d4d80edd64141ae014c1a1a3f","permalink":"https://kaushik333.github.io/project/edge-detection-and-toolpath-generation-for-3d-meshes/","publishdate":"2020-10-17T21:15:05-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/edge-detection-and-toolpath-generation-for-3d-meshes/","section":"project","summary":"This is an ongoing ARM funded project where the goal is to automate finishing tasks in manufacturing processes.

One of the applications we were addressing was to perform 3D recosntruction of molecule given various 2D projections of the same. The imaging procedure, Cryo-EM is very noisy and is hard to obtain many image. There is also no control over the angle at which the molecule is images as they are taken randomly. Furthermore, the molecule considered also has icosohedral symmetry. The goal of the project is to first estimate the 3D (euler or quaternion) angles of each of these images, and then perform 3D reconstruction of the molecule. A maximum likelihood based approach (Hetero) is first used to estimate these angles which serves as a ground truth and then a neural network is learned to regress these angles. We also develop a disentangled VAE to learn the angles explicitly at the latent space and then use latent space interpolations to generate images of unseen angles and in-turn obtain better 3D reconstruction.

Temporal re-parametrization as a model can account for variability in the underlying generative process, sampling rate variations, or plain temporal mis-alignment. In this paper, we extend prior work in disentangling latent spaces of autoencoding models, to design a novel architecture to learn rate-invariant latent codes in a completely unsupervised fashion. Unlike conventional neural network architectures, this method allows to explicitly disentangle temporal parameters in the form of orderpreserving diffeomorphisms with respect to a learnable template. This makes the latent space more easily interpretable. We show the efficacy of our approach on a synthetic dataset and a real dataset for hand action-recognition.","tags":[],"title":"Rate Invariant Autoencoding of Time Series - ICASSP 2020","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1575072000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575072000,"objectID":"dce7806d4be3cd4310e1876b6c8839bc","permalink":"https://kaushik333.github.io/project/passive-object-detection-for-accountability-in-manufacturing-processes/","publishdate":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/passive-object-detection-for-accountability-in-manufacturing-processes/","section":"project","summary":"The main goal is to create an automated tracking and traceability solution for part accountability in manufacturing processes.

Several recent works using deep learning are very effective at producing disentangled representations. However, in the unsupervised setting, there is no way to pre-specify which part of the latent space captures specific factors of variations. While this is generally a hard problem because of the non-existence of analytical expressions to capture these variations, there are certain factors like geometric transforms that can be expressed analytically. Furthermore, in existing frameworks, the disentangled values are also not interpretable. The focus of this work is to disentangle these geometric factors of variations (which turn out to be nuisance factors for many applications) from the semantic content of the signal in an interpretable manner which in turn makes the features more discriminative. Experiments are designed to show the modularity of the approach with other disentangling strategies as well as on multiple one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) datasets, clearly indicating the efficacy of the proposed approach.

SAR images consist of high-resolution reflected returns of radar frequency energy from terrain illuminated by directed beam of pulses generated by the SAR system. In the case of aircrafts, these SAR images are displayed on the cockpit, transmitted to ground station as well as stored in on-board storage disks. SAR images serve as vital source of information for a large variety of applications which includes reconnaissance, automatic target recognition and mapping of geographical area. There is an urge to compress SAR images which would in turn reduce the transmission time of SAR images from on-board systems to ground station. SAR image compression will also reduce the memory requirements on-board. In this paper, two approaches for SAR image compression using optimum threshold based Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression are proposed. The first approach uses only proposed SVM regression, whereas the second approach is a two-stage SAR image compression using standard 1-level wavelet decomposition followed by proposed SVM regression. In order to assess the efficacy of the proposed system, datasets from USC-SIPI image databases are employed and 67.81-77.36% image compression is achieved with a PSNR ranging between 36.20dB and 43.12dB.","tags":[],"title":"SAR Image Compression Using Optimal Thresold Based Support Vector Machines - INDICON 2016","type":"publication"}]
